# Reflex Replay Browser

An addon + script for Reflex Arena that adds an in-game replay browser.

## Usage

Running `script.py` or `script.exe` will populate the addon file `ReplayBrowserData.lua` with all replays in your `replays` directory and its subdirectories. If your configuration has already been populated, using the command line parameter `-p` will automatically start Reflex if needed and kill the script when Reflex is closed.
